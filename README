CP-ACE functions are utilities to exchange data between processes
where we know only to which processes each process sends data but do
not know from how many processes each process receives in parallel
programming.

The installation procedure is written on the INSTALL file.
Sample programs of CP-ACE functions and the function reference are
written in the document.pdf. Source codes of sample programs are

  mpi_export.c for CP-ACE function implemented on MPI 
  mpi_export_f90.f90 for Fortran interface to the function
  mpi_export_f.f for Fortran 77 interface to the function
  acp_export.c for CP-ACE functions implemented on ACP
